# EXCLUDED RULES
# ==============
# AL07 - Avoid table aliases in from clauses and join conditions.
# ST06 - Select wildcards then simple targets before calculations and aggregates.
# ST07 - Prefer specifying join keys instead of using USING.
# AM03 - Ambiguous ordering directions for columns in order by clause.
# ST04 - Dont mess up nested CASE statement
# LT05 - Line is too long
# AL05 - Tables should not be aliased if that alias is not used.
