## FAQ

1. I installed dataform cli after installing the extension and it does not work now

   -  Uninstall the extension and re-install it. As currently it does not complete the registration of commands/disposables when a cli is missing

    ```bash

    #uninstall
    npm uninstall -g @dataform/cli

    #install
    npm i -g @dataform/cli@^3.0.0-beta

    ```
